# CLI Learning Path

This page helps you choose the right CLI guide by experience level.

If you are new to Raven:
1. `getting-started.md`
2. `configuration.md`
3. `schema-intro.md`
4. `cli-basics.md`

## Choose your CLI guide

### `cli-basics.md` (first day)

Use this when you want:
- daily note and capture workflows
- creating and updating objects
- running basic queries
- safe navigation/editing habits

### `cli-advanced.md` (after basics)

Use this when you want:
- bulk operations and preview/confirm patterns
- schema evolution and migration workflows
- validation/reindex troubleshooting
- workflow automation and scripting patterns

## Reference vs guide

Guides are for learning and sequencing.
Reference pages are for exact syntax lookup.

- Use `reference/cli.md` when you already know the command you need.
- Use `cli-basics.md` or `cli-advanced.md` when deciding *how* to work.
